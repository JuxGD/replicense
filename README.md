# replicense
(pronounced reply-sense (sounds like license), or replee-sense (preferably))
(shortened as rpli)

## Usage
The replicense is a license intended for community FAQs, but if you think this license fits any other type of project, then by all means go ahead and use this license.

## About this repository
This repository is for information about rpli, and is linked in the license, much like how GPLv3 has a link to the official page.

The repo also includes many formats of rpli, like plain text and Markdown.

## About rpli
I wanted to try and make a simple license, that is straightforward and easy to understand. For example, you look at licenses like the LGPLv3 and you have to read not one, but TWO long licences (because LGPLv3 is an extension of GPLv3). The normal MIT license is already kinda complicated, even the Unlicense uses unnecessarily complicated words. I understand that you have to be specific when stating the permissions others have, so that people have it very clear when it comes to what's allowed and what's not, but oftentimes, those licenses written in such a complicated manner that I think defeats the point.

## Contributing
If you've "ported" rpli to a different format, I encourage you to submit a pull request with the new format(s). Please do NOT change the license itself. Changes to the license should be discussed in the issue tracker.
